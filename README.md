# Restaurant Website

By Anton Clayton

## Skills used:
- JavaScript
- JSX
- CSS
- React

## Description: 
This project is partly a follow along of another project by Javascript Mastery on Youtube with my own touches. I found myself unable to style my own websites/projects in a professional way and so I wanted to concentrate on a project that would teach file structure, React, and CSS styling. The website is a "mock" website for a restaurant called "Gericht" and offers a professional, attractive design. 

## What I learned:
- BEM naming convention for class names
- Efficient, clean React file structure
- General CSS styling tricks and skills
- Using js files to import many components/images in one line of code
- How to build the foundation/plan for a react app
